<h1>Lyricus preferences</h1>
<h2>Site priorities</h2>
<p>
Lyricus fetches its lyrics from multiple sources. To select which sites to use, simply check the checkbox next to a site's name.<br />
To change the order in which the sites are queried, drag the site names in the order you want them.
</p>

<h2>Lyric display is always on top</h2>
<p>
If this setting is activated, the lyric window will always appear above all other windows, even when Lyricus is not active.
</p>

<h2>Don't warn about index age</h2>
<p>
By default, Lyricus will warn when your reverse lyric search index is over one week old. Use this option to disable the warning.
</p>

<h2>Text and background colors</h2>
<p>
You can change the text and background colors used in the main window.<br />
It's recommended that the <i>edit mode background</i> color is slightly different from the standard background color to make it easy to see when edit mode is active.<br />
For more information on edit mode, see <i><a href="editing.html">editing</a></i>.
